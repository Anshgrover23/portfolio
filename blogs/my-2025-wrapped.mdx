## My 2025 Wrapped

This year has been quite productive for me in the open source space. I earned over **$40,000 USD** in bounties by contributing to various projects and solving technical challenges.

I also became the top contributor at Antiwork in terms of bounties collected. In addition to that, I won **$1,200 USD** from Algora.io bounties and earned **$2,000 USD** through GitHub Sponsorships for my work on TSCircuit.

On a more personal note, I treated myself to some new gear - got myself an **iPhone 15** and **MacBook Air**. I also completed a **$500** freelance project, which was a nice addition to my income.

I had the opportunity to connect with several founders and interesting people throughout the year. One highlight was meeting **Harkirat Singh** and visiting both **Super30** and **100xSchool**.

Looking back, I realize I spent quite a bit of time on college assignments and exams that didn't really add much value to my learning or career development.
I should have focused more on building my own projects and contributing to open source instead.

2025 showed me consistent coding creates real opportunities. Can't wait to see what 2026 brings!
